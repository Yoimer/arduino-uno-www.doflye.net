# Make sure the ARDUINO UNO R3.0 board bought at www.doflye.net is recongnized by your PC following instructions below.
# In this case we are using Windows XP SP3 English language.
# Get the drivers for his board at http://www.winchiphead.com/download/CH341/CH341SER.ZIP
# The CH341SER.EXE file is on the IDE-1.6.5 folder also.
# Install the drivers.
# Right Click on My Computer, Properties, Hardware, Device Manager, Ports(COM & LPT)
